                            <p>
                                Prior to launching a firm in India, it is important to decide on the goals, organisational structure, and operational procedures that
                                will guide the choice of type of the company. The privately held entity or firm type known as a Private Limited Company in India
                                which is one of the most popular among the business owners. It can have up to 50 shareholders, limiting the owner's ability to
                                sell their shares publicly, and caps the owner's liability to their shares.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though it is expensive, registering a Private Limited Company offers various benefits, such as,
                            </p>
                            <h3>Limited Responsibility</h3>
                            <p>
                                A Private Limited Company's stockholders do not get into the risk of losing their personal assets when a business is on the verge
                                of closing due to unanticipated financial difficulties in their business. The only thing that would be lost is the money used to
                                launch the business; the Director's personal belongings would be protected. In General Partnership Firms, Partners must sell
                                their own belongings to pay back debts if the company is unable to pay them. Partners are personally liable for these debts.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Obtaining Funds for their Business</h3>
                            <p>
                                Due to their restricted liability and unique shareholder and director roles, private limited corporations are well-suited to equity
                                finance. Private equity funds and venture capitalists are unlikely to invest in any other structure. LLPs would require them to join
                                the company as partners, whereas an OPC can only have one shareholder. Additionally, businesses who cannot afford to pay
                                high salaries might use shares to recruit strong talents for their organization, hence lowering salaries.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Borrowing Power</h3>
                            <p>As it has more alternatives for taking on debt, a private limited company is allowed to borrow more money than an LLP. In addition
                                to being simple to get (in comparison to OPCs and LLPs), issuing debentures and convertible debentures is always an option.
                                Private limited businesses are more welcomed by banks and other financial institutions than partnership-based entities.</p>
                            <h3>Greater Legitimacy</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Registrar of Companies must have access to a lot of information regarding a Private Limited Company's operations, structure,
                                and finances. The public eventually has access to this information. As a result, information about the firm, such as the authorised
                                capital, directors' names, registration office, etc., can be found by suppliers, lenders, and employees. When compared to firms
                                that are not required to provide this information, businesses that do so are seen as more reliable (such as partnerships
                                and proprietorships).
                            </p>
                            <h3>Simple Exit</h3>
                            <p>
                                Private limited firms can be sold or transferred to another person or company in whole or in part without causing any alterations
                                to their current operations.
                            </p>
                            <h3>International Expansion</h3>
                            <p>
                                It's critical to get investments and establish partnerships with foreign businesses if a company wants to develop products or
                                services on a Worldwide scale or Internationally and grow its operations Internationally. Private Limited firms have the advantage
                                of allowing FDI up to 100% via the automatic method, which means no government approval is necessary for foreign corporations
                                to invest in India. This goes against LLPs and partnerships, both of which require government approval.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Scope Of Several Possibilities</h3>
                            <p>
                                Entrepreneurs who are successful are constantly searching for possibilities in as many businesses or areas as they can. They
                                frequently like to take chances and try new things. As a firm develops over time, private limited corporations can take advantage
                                of opportunities that sole proprietorships and partnerships are unable to because of their ties to the promoter.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Improved Governance</h3>
                            <p>Private limited companies are more organised and add value for owners since they are subject to strict regulations under the
                                Companies Act of 2013 and must adhere to disclosure standards and other legal criteria. So, compared to other entities, a private
                                limited corporation gives significantly more benefits. It is better to hire legal professionals to handle the company registration.</p>
